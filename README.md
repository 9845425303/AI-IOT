# Artificial Intelligence-Powered Location Detection service Solving Geofencing Limitations for Smart Homes


Providing a remedy for poorly performing GPS-based geofencing solutions that require people to carry their phones with them, the new microservice can intelligently detect and understand occupancy conditions of a home based on motion patterns derived from activity sensors. Complex occupancy status decisions are made quickly and accurately from data through a combination of patent pending machine learning algorithms, designed to determine the four essential occupancy states of home, away, vacation and sleep along with the transitions between those states. Highly complex algorithms extract several dozen dimensions of occupancy factors in the home from thousands of data points, including the day, time, door activity, motion activity, energy and water use, supporting geofencing data and more.

The Home Occupancy Status is also capable of knowing when people are asleep to deliver advanced automation, senior care and wellness solutions from understanding a person’s natural sleep patterns. Able to put a home to sleep or wake it up gently to better prepare residents for the day, improvements to a person’s routine are possible through sleep predictions to intelligently adjust home temperature and lighting conditions appropriate for the time of day, the day itself, and even the season. Senior care solutions become more intelligent and supportive by understanding away, at home, asleep or awake states of older adults. With its ability to integrate hundreds of wirelessly connected smart home devices from manufacturers.

Benefits can include:
Geofencing without dependence on a smartphone
Artificial Intelligence (AI) determines occupancy automatically
Solves geofencing problems for multi-tenant occupancy
Revolutionary development of sleep mode detection
